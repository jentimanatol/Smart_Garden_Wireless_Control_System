\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose and Vision}
The Smart Garden project was initiated to serve as a bridge between classroom theory and practical engineering implementation. Its design encourages students and faculty to collaborate across fields such as electronics, computer science, mathematics, information technology, mechanical engineering, cybersecurity, and biology.

The overarching vision is to demonstrate that \textbf{BHCC stands as a leading college in Boston, MA}, capable of developing research-grade technology that merges sustainability with innovation.

\subsection{Scientific and Educational Context}
The project embodies the core principles of the modern Internet of Things (IoT): sensing, communication, computation, and control. By applying rigorous methodology and academic standards, the team built a modular architecture that can evolve from a teaching tool into a research-grade experimental platform.

The Smart Garden initiative emphasizes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Interdisciplinary Collaboration:} every department contributes a scientific component.
  \item \textbf{Educational Value:} real hardware and data for lab integration.
  \item \textbf{Sustainability:} precise irrigation and minimal resource waste.
  \item \textbf{Scalability:} adaptable to greenhouse, campus, or community garden networks.
\end{itemize}

\section{System Architecture and Operation}

\subsection{Overview}
The system is composed of three interconnected microcontroller nodes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Main Hub (Arduino Mega 2560)} — Receives sensor data, makes decisions, displays data on a 3.5" TFT, and transmits pump control signals.
  \item \textbf{Soil Sensor Node (Arduino Nano)} — Measures temperature, humidity, and soil moisture; transmits results wirelessly.
  \item \textbf{Pump Node (Arduino Nano)} — Receives control commands and operates a relay or SSR controlling a water pump.
\end{itemize}

\caption{Overall architecture of the Smart Garden RF System showing sensor, hub, and actuator nodes.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Communication Flow}
The communication system is based on the nRF24L01+ transceiver, operating in the 2.4~GHz ISM band using Enhanced ShockBurst™ protocol with automatic acknowledgment and retransmission.

\begin{figure}[H]\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figs/A_flowchart_in_Figure_1_depicts_the_architecture_o.png}
\caption{RF communication flow between Soil Sensor Node, Main Hub, and Pump Node.}
\end{figure}

Each transmission includes a packet header, payload, checksum, and acknowledgment handshake. This approach ensures robust data integrity even in noisy environments.

\subsection{Data Pipeline}
The data flow can be represented as:
\[
\text{Sensor Data} \rightarrow \text{RF Transmission} \rightarrow \text{Main Hub Processing} \rightarrow \text{Pump Control Command}.
\]

\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\subsection{Pin Connections}
Pin assignments were carefully optimized to minimize interference between the TFT and SPI buses.

\subsection{Power and Grounding}
All nodes share a common ground reference. Decoupling capacitors (100~µF + 0.1~µF) are placed near each RF module to stabilize voltage under transmission bursts.

\section{Software and Firmware Logic}

\subsection{Decision Algorithm}
The control algorithm is based on hysteresis:
\[
\text{Pump ON if } M \leq 40\%, \quad \text{Pump OFF if } M \geq 55\%.
\]
A five-minute safety timer prevents prolonged activation, and a five-second timeout ensures fail-safe shutdown on communication loss.

\subsection{Firmware Structure}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Sensor Node:} initializes sensors, collects data, transmits RF packets.
  \item \textbf{Main Hub:} listens for data, computes logic, displays results, and transmits commands.
  \item \textbf{Pump Node:} receives commands, toggles relay, applies timeout failsafe.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Display Interface}
The TFT shows:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Soil Moisture (\%)
  \item Air Temperature and Humidity
  \item Pump Status (ON/OFF)
  \item Communication Delay and Packet Sequence
\end{enumerate}

\section{RF Communication and Data Integrity}

\subsection{Enhanced ShockBurst Protocol}
The nRF24L01+ handles packet retransmission automatically. Each packet is validated by a CRC checksum to ensure data integrity. Loss detection is implemented via sequence numbering.

\subsection{RF Packet Format}
\[
[\text{SEQ, Timestamp, Moisture, Temp, Humidity, Status, CRC}]
\]
Each frame is under 32 bytes to remain within the transceiver’s maximum payload length.

\subsection{System Data Flow Diagram}
\begin{figure}[H]\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figs/data_pipeline.png}
\caption{System data pipeline from sensors to cloud-ready data logging.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Signal Reliability}
Signal reliability was tested over various distances (1–15 m indoors). At 250 kbps, packet loss remained below 0.1\%, proving high resilience for educational and field demonstrations.

\section{Mathematical Modeling and Data Compression}

\subsection{Compression Model}
The data rate \( R \) can be minimized as:
\[
R = \frac{N \cdot L}{T}
\]
where \(N\) = number of packets, \(L\) = bits per packet, \(T\) = time interval. 

Mathematics students propose encoding schemes such as delta encoding and run-length compression to optimize transmission efficiency.

\subsection{Predictive Analytics}
Regression models in RStudio:
\[
M_t = \alpha + \beta_1 T_t + \beta_2 H_t + \epsilon_t
\]
where \(M_t\) is soil moisture, \(T_t\) temperature, \(H_t\) humidity. The residual error \( \epsilon_t \) provides model validation.
